\chapter{Problem statement}

\subsection{Problem}

The purpose of this project is to develop an Operating System compliant to the ARINC 653 standard, that would run on a small embedded system. 

The main characteristic of the OS would be that the application space is a partitioned environment.
Data exchange should be predictable, that is why the standard defines the APEX.

The final product would be able to let developers and technicians work on safety critical systems,
 without having to have a deep understanding of the standard.

\subsection{Questions}

The main question to answer is:\\
How to implement ARINC 653 on the STM32 microcontroller?\\

Questions to be answered in relation to the main goal:\\
What is ARINC 653?\\
Main obstacles when developing an OS?\\
What would be the impact of this system on the developers working in the field?\\
Is there anybody that looked for a open-source ARINC 653 implementetion?\\
Where would such a system be used?\\
How does the standard differentiates between other Operating Systems?\\
Pros and Cons of the ARINC 653 standard?\\

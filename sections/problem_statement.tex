\chapter{Problem statement}
\label{chap:Problem_Statement}

The goal of this project is to initiate the development of an \arinc{}
operating system called \OSname{} based on the task defined in the
\nameref{ch:introduction}.
\\\\
The goal give rise to the following problem statement:
\\\\
\textit{Can an OS implementation based on a subset of the \arinc{} standard be
developed on a Mini-M4?}
\\\\
Based on the knowledge acquired in the \nameref{chap:analysis}
and limited by the time scheduled for the project, this problem can be expanded
into the following sub-questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Which features must be developed to make \OSname{} functional and testable?
	\item How can this system be developed without the use of pre-existing
		implementations?
	\item How is this system implemented using C and python?
	\item What are the main obstacles when developing such a system?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Problem statement}


The purpose of this project is to initiate the development an Operating System compliant to the 
ARINC 653 standard, that would run on a small embedded system. 
\todo {partially compliant?}
The choice of hardware has to be done in the early stages, while the software characteristics
have to be thought over throughout the process.
\\\\
The main characteristic of the OS would be that the application space is a partitioned environment.
The partitions would have to be set up in the beginning using an XML file, which contains their 
characteristics. Each partition is allocated an amount of memory, thus the system should be able to restrict memory space accordingly.
Furthermore, each partition is allocated a time interval for running its applications. This means
that the scheduler should have access to time resources. Each partition should have access to the 
low level hardware, and data exchange should be predictable through the APEX. 
\\\\
From this, the following questions arose, in relation to the main goal:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the main obstacles when developing such a system?
	\item How is this implementation of an Operating System different from other implementations?
	\item Is there a need for an open-source ARINC 653 implementation?
\todo {Pros and Cons of the ARINC 653 standard?}

\end{itemize}

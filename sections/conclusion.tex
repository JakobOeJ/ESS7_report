\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

In this chapter the OS developed in this project is reviewed and conclued if the aproach to the problem 
statement on chapter 3 on page 15 was successful and are the possible uses in the future.\\

\section{Discussion}
The main concerns presented by the forums communities were the security levels of the implementation of 
this OS. The two main topics were: how to identify an error and how to track it to the origin and how the 
system will react to different levels of failure, from small to fatal errors. If the entire system would 
reboot, only restart the partition or block it.\\
Other problems suggested were related to the interrupts, when context switching if the next partition 
would also have acess to all them, and how the control is made to prevent any errors related.\\
The idea of an OpenSource implementation like this was well accepted due to the lack of examples avaiable. 
It was given an example of an implementation in the USA, of a similar system and that is still used for
communication infrastructures.
The whole text is presented in the \nameref{chap:Forum Responces}.

\section{Perspective}



\section{The actual conclusion}
The theme of this project is Embedded Software Systems, and the chosen project is the development of and 
OS. The purpose of the project is to make a functional OS according to ARINC653 standards, that is able to 
run different processes in independent partitions from each other. This OS should then be implemented in 
the chip STM32.\\
\\
The main problem statement from chapter 3 on page 15 said the following: Can an OS implementation based on 
a subset of the ARINC653 standard be developed on a Mini-M4?\\
\\
As described in section ?? on page ?? this project focuses solely on making an
implementation of a part of the Standard, not covering all the features and security parameters.\\
\\
The problem statement is answered as follows;\\

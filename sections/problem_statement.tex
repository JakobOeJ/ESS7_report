\chapter{Problem statement}


The purpose of this project is to initiate 
the development of the ARINC 653 operating 
system defined by the decisions in the analysis section.
\\\\
The OS will be implemented on the Mini-M4.
It will be a new OS written from scratch 
called open653. The chosen programming 
language is C, with some initialisation 
done in Python.
\\\\
The following questions arose from the defined scope:
\begin{itemize}
 \item What are the main obstacles when developing such a system?
 \item What makes this Operating System implementation different from others?
 \item Can this OS be useful in non-avionics industries?
 \item What uses ca an open-source ARINC 653 implementation provide?
\end{itemize}

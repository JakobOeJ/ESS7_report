\chapter{Conclusion}
\textit{Which features must be developed to make \OSname{} functional and
testable?}\\
The features required to make the system functional and testable are listed in \nameref{design:features} section \ref{design:features}
and the implemented features are listed in \ref{feature_list}.\\

\textit{How can this system be developed without the use of pre-existing
implementations?}\\
\OSname{} is developed as a ground up implementation on top of the MINI-M4.
The HAL library has been used to supplement the development of most drivers and hardware specific functions.\\

\textit{How is this system implemented using C and Python?}\\
Python is used for parsing the XML into C structures which is used for building the source code.
C is used to program \OSname{} and its partitions.\\

\textit{What are the main obstacles when developing such a system?}\\
There were no big challenges preventing the development of \OSname{},
however among the eareas  there were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item understanding the need for using special GCC attributes when constructing special functions for context switching
	\item Establishing a JTAG connection when assembling the hardware
	\item Deciding on a auto-generated data structure
\end{itemize}

\section{The actual conclusion}
The theme of this project is Embedded Software Systems, and the chosen project is the development of and
OS. The purpose of the project is to make a functional OS according to ARINC653 standards, that is able to
run different processes in independent partitions from each other. This OS should then be implemented in
the chip STM32.\\
\\
The main problem statement from chapter 3 on page 15 said the following: Can an OS implementation based on
a subset of the ARINC653 standard be developed on a Mini-M4?\\
\\
As described in section ?? on page ?? this project focuses solely on making an
implementation of a part of the Standard, not covering all the features and security parameters.\\
\\
The problem statement is answered as follows;\\

\section{Discussion}
\iffalse
The main concerns presented by the forums communities were the security levels of the implementation of
this OS. The two main topics were: how to identify an error and how to track it to the origin and how the
system will react to different levels of failure, from small to fatal errors. If the entire system would
reboot, only restart the partition or block it.\\
Other problems suggested were related to the interrupts, when context switching if the next partition
would also have acess to all them, and how the control is made to prevent any errors related.\\
The idea of an OpenSource implementation like this was well accepted due to the lack of examples avaiable.
It was given an example of an implementation in the USA, of a similar system and that is still used for
communication infrastructures.
The whole text is presented in the \nameref{chap:Forum Responces}.

The implementation of \OSname{} as a whole was an interesting challenge
to say the least. Based on the group\textquotesingle s decisions taken in the beginning 
of the project, the path it followed proved to provide challenging, but
approachable problems to solve. However, an important thing to mention
(be proud of), is that the project never came to a halt, and the group 
members definitely see exciting perspectives for how their work could be
used in the future. \\
A positive thing that maybe influenced the project in ways \textbf{we} are 
not aware of, are the different backgrounds of the group members, as well as
the diversity of tasks generated by the project\textquotesingle s goal.

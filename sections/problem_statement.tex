\chapter{Problem statement}

\subsection{Problem}

The purpose of this project is to develop an Operating System compliant to the ARINC 653 standard, that would run on a small embedded system. 

The main characteristic of the OS would be that the application space is a partitioned environment.
Data exchange should be predictable, that is why the standard defines the APEX.

The final product would be able to let developers work on safety critical systems,
 without having to have a deep understanding of the standard.

\subsection{Questions}

Main question:\\
How to implement ARINC on a STM32?\\

Other questions to be answered:\\
What is ARINC 653?\\
Main obstacles when developing this?\\
What would be the impact of this system on the developers working in the field?\\
Is there anybody that looked for a open-source ARINC 653 implementetion?\\
Where would such a system be used?\\
How does the standard differentiates between other Operating Systems?\\

\chapter{Testing}

\section{MPU}
In order to test the memory partition mapping, for an amount of space given, we use a non-specific initial
 pointer representing the begining of the memory free space, specific sizes for each partition and we
  write in each memory position the number of the partition that is ocupied with. In the end we print the
   whole memory avaiable for the test and confirm if the space given for each is enough and if they are
    allocated in the right place.\\
 The tests cover the different partition memory distribuitions in memory, for the 3 cases if having 1, 2 or
  3 subregions non used by the main partition of the region.

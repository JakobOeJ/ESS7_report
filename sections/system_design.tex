\subsection{Drivers}
\begin{description}[align=left]
	\item [\textbf{UART driver}] The UART is used by the system to communicate with the outside
	world. This can either receive or transmit data to another UART device.
	\item [\textbf{Watchdog timer driver}] The watchdog timer is necessary to ensure recovery
	in case of a hardware fault or program error. If this happens, the program would be restarted
	from a safe state.

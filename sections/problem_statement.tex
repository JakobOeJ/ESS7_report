\chapter{Problem statement}

\section{Problem}

The purpose of this project is to develop an Operating System compliant to the ARINC 653 standard, that would run on a small embedded system. \\

The main characteristic of the OS would be that the application space is a partitioned environment.
The partitions would have to be set up in the beginning using an XML file, which contains their 
characteristics.
Each partition is allocated an amount of memory, thus the system should be able to restrict memory 
space accordingly.
Furthermore, each partition is allocated a time interval for running its applications. This means
that the scheduler should have access to time resources. 
Each partition should have access to the I/O.
Data exchange should be predictable, that is why the standard defines the APEX. 

\section{Questions}


Questions to be answered in relation to the main goal:\\
\begin{itemize}

	\item Main obstacles when developing an OS?
	\item What would be the impact of this system on the developers working in the field?
	\item Is there anybody that looked for a open-source ARINC 653 implementetion?
	\item Where would such a system be used?
	\item How does the standard differentiates between other Operating Systems?
	\item Pros and Cons of the ARINC 653 standard?
	\item How to convert the XML file, in order to use the settings defined there, at compile time?
	\item How to implement the system specific functions on top of the HAL library?
